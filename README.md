## 👋 About me
Hello, my name is Thomaz! I am a student in the world of technology. I am currently in my 5th semester of Computer Science at the Pontifical Catholic University of Rio Grande do Sul (PUCRS), one of the most renowned educational institutions in Brazil. Since I was a child, I have always been very interested in topics related to games of all kinds, such as RPGs, FPS, and TPS, for example. With that in mind, I hope to one day have the opportunity to work in the field of computer graphics and game development.
